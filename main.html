          <em>Note: This is a visual game that relies on using a mouse.</em>

        <p>
          Try clicking the button to turn it red. It's not impossible!
        </p>

        <div class="centerer">
          <!-- Hide the mouse-area until script is run. If no javascript, don't
            want to show these elements -->

              <!-- We want the below to *look* like a button to visual users,
                but we don't want it to be a actual button element because it
                has no actual action beyond a presentational effect. Therefore,
                we don't want it to be a focusable element or interpreted as a
                button by the browser.
                Similarly, we want to hide it from screen readers since the text
                is decorative rather than descriptive -->
              <span id="button" aria-hidden="true">
                Click me

            before we load the rest -->

          Some fun things to try:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Hitting the button with the mouse at different speeds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the button bounce off the mouse in different directions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrolling the mouse into the button.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zooming into the button.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div> <!-- end page content -->
